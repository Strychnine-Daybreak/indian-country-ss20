<h2>History</h2>
	     <p><strong>February 2, 1848 —</strong> The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Guadalupe-Hidalgo" target="_blank">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> was ratified, placing most of the Tohono O’odham Nation’s land in Mexico.<br /><br /> <strong>June 8, 1854 —</strong> The United States paid Mexico $10 million in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Gadsden-Purchase" target="_blank">Gadsden Purchase</a> for nearly 30 square miles of land, drawing a new border between the U.S. and Mexico that split the Tohono O’odham and their land.<br /><br /> <strong>1993 —</strong> President Bill Clinton orders the construction of a border wall 13 miles long between the U.S. and Mexico, stretching from San Diego to Tijuana.<br /><br /> <strong>2000 —</strong> Increased border security requires the Tohono O’odham peoples to show papers as they cross the border between their traditional lands in the United States and Mexico.<br /><br /> <strong>May 11, 2005 —</strong> The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/418" target="_blank">Real ID Act</a> is passed, allowing for the secretary of homeland security to waive all federal, state, and local laws to construct a border barrier, including environmental, cultural, public health, or safety laws, exempting the construction of the border wall from legal compliance and participation in public processes.<br /><br /> <strong>October 26, 2006 —</strong> President George W. Bush signs the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/6061" target="_blank">Secure Fence Act</a> into effect, promising the construction of 700 miles of fence along the border in addition to virtual wall along all 2,000 miles of the border.<br /><br /> <strong>July-August, 2007 —</strong> Despite concerns voiced by the Tohono O’odham about five cultural sites that exist along the border and in the path of the proposed wall, the Department of Homeland Security reports their findings that the construction of the wall will not have a significant impact.<br /><br /> <strong>2008 —</strong> Congress allows the Department of Homeland Security to move ahead with the implementation of fencing while circumventing over 30 environmental laws.<br /><br /> <strong>2011 —</strong> The Department of Homeland Security has completed 649 miles of border fencing.<br /><br /> <strong>August 31, 2017 —</strong> Caddell Construction, Fisher Sand & Gravel/DBA Fisher Industries, Texas Sterling Construction and W.G. Yates & Sons Construction were selected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to build prototypes for the wall.<br /><br /> <strong>November 6, 2018 —</strong> The first new construction of the wall begins with the construction of a 6-mile levee along the Rio Grande.<br /><br /> <strong>February 15, 2019 —</strong> President Donald Trump declares a national emergency with the goal of obtaining $8 billion in funding.<br /><br /> <strong>July 1, 2019 —</strong> A federal judge blocks the expansion of the border wall paid for with military funds.<br /><br /> <strong>July 28, 2019 —</strong> The Supreme court overturns the previous injunction, allowing construction to move forward using funds previously allocated for the Department of Defense.<br /><br /> <strong>August 22, 2019 —</strong> Construction begins on a 2-mile section of the wall at the official entry point in Lukeville, Arizona. This was the first section of the wall to be built using funds diverted to the project under the declaration of emergency.<br /><br /> <strong>November 9, 2019 —</strong> O’odham activists gather at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument Visitor’s Center to protest the destruction of their ancestral land and its resources for the construction of the wall.<br /><br /> <strong>January 8, 2020 —</strong> Arizona lawmakers introduce a bill would exempt border wall construction on private property from a building permit and amend state regulations.<br /><br /> <strong>February, 2020 —</strong> In southwest Arizona, construction crews began blasting hills in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to clear rock for the construction of the wall. The blasts occurred at the base of Monument Hill, a site considered sacred to the Tohono O’odham because it is the final resting place for its former inhabitants and was also the site of several battles.</p>

<h2>Destruction of Life</h2>
  <h3>Ecosystem Disruption</h3>
	     <p>Organ Pipe National Monument has an extremely unique and fragile ecosystem that relies on the springs of Quitobaquito as its source of life. Because much of the water in Organ Pipe is being drained to mix concrete for the wall, the lack of water disrupts the entire ecosystem. To make matters worse, Richard Saunders, the Executive Director of Public Safety for the Tohono O’odham, makes clear that the environment will suffer as the finished wall will block a significant source of water for the tribe and all others that share their land. Ryan Devereaux of <em>The Intercept</em> writes that construction of the wall has endangered many species belonging to this ecosystem by disrupting migratory patterns, as is the case for the prowling jaguar, and destroying habitats, as is the case for the rare Sonoyta mud turtle, or outright massacre of a population, as is the case for the giant saguaro cactus.<br /><br />The saguaro cacti are more than sacred to the Tohono O’odham. In fact, they are themselves considered to be a people. The population of saguaro that can be found around the construction site in Organ Pipe were healthy and were expected to have lived for decades had they not been bulldozed down to clear a path for the wall. Vice Chairman Verlon Jose of the Tohono O’odham explains that the land is not theirs to own, or anyone’s for that matter, but it is their job to protect it. With this in mind, the devastation felt by the Tohono O’odham Nation as a result of the complete disregard for the saguaro is clear.</p>
  <h3>Desecration of Grave Sites</h3>
	     <p>Just as pressing as the disruption of the Organ Pipe ecosystem, if not more, is the destruction of life at burial grounds and gravesites. <em>Cultural Property News</em> reports that not only will the wall complicate Tohono O’odham access to their ancestral burial grounds, but it will also pose a physical threat to the spirituality of these sacred locations as they can be destroyed during construction. In addition to serving as a sort of oasis for Organ Pipe, Quitobaquito is home to many well-documented Hia-C’ed O’odham burial grounds and gravesites. Nellie Jo David, an O’odham activist, indicates that these grounds, located feet from the border, must be protected and preserved because many of those remembered there are their ancestors.<br /><br />The construction of the wall threatens numerous sites with ancestral and historical significance to more than one tribe. Monument Hill is considered sacred by the O’odham peoples and is home to the burial ground of Apache warriors killed in conflict with the O’odham. Las Playas contains sacred O’odham ceremonial grounds as documented by oral history in addition to archaeologists. Cabeza Prieta wildlife refuge is another sacred burial ground four miles to the west. Despite O’odham protests against continuations of the project, Monument Hill has already been the site of controlled blasting to clear a path for the wall, and other grounds significant to the Tohono O’odham and other tribes impeding the progress of construction will be targeted next.</p>
